# Python - my Python projects

## About
Since I wanted not to litter my Github with many (and sometimes unfinished) Python projects, I created this repository to store most of them in one place. They can be freely used, developed or just used as an idea to create similar or even better programs. Any projects that will be "more worthy" will be published in an individual repository.
